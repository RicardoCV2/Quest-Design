## Introduction

It does not matter if they are small or large characteristics of a videogame, the missions have to have a development behind that helps both the player and the game itself, they are a factor that helps the feeling of immersion and of affiliation to the game that depends on creating a link with the player. A large majority of games tend to have a very bad approach in terms of Quest Design as they do not emphasize creating a game aimed for Quest Design and simply give it less relevance at the time of creation, this can tend to create a game and a totally flat product since it does not obtain factors of evolution. Companies that invest a lot of time and relevance in the questing aspect unlike the others, end up obtaining a great benefit and success by this aspect (e.g., The Witcher 3).
 During the article, three points will be the pinnacles for the research and the better understanding of what quests mean for a videogame and how much importance they have.
 * What they **are**
 * What they **must be like**
 * What do they **transmit**
 
 # Quest - Main Quest - Side Quest
 
### Definition

“Quests are this place in a video game where game design, gaming and technology all come together.” [Jeszek Szczepanski - Building Non-Linear Narratives in Horizon: Zero Dawn (GDC 2017).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykPZcG8_mPU&feature=youtu.be)

The basic definition would be a task for a player or a group of players that may be completed to obtain a rewarding after succesfully completing it.

From this point we can focus on any action that the player makes can be converted into a quest, we simply have to award him a prize after completing that action. This factor is very short of explanation because within the action of the player we can find and have to be able to differentiate between a main quest and a side quest.

### Main Quest & Side Quests
Most people tend to think that a Main QUest is simply an action that you must complete to advance the game, and instead a Side Quest is a mission that the game or you decide whether to fulfill or not, no important effect on the core of the game. The problem with this conception is that if, for example, the history of a game is divided into different mission chains, and you choose the "A" option, this does not imply a set of missions that you had to complete to advance through the history of the game if you had decided otherwise. Similarly, there are some Side Quests that players must complete in order to level up or grind, making them not that “skippable” anymore.

### Main Quests 

According to Dean Razavi, Razbury Games Game Designer. a main quest is a big change in the plot of the narrative arc that create a new path for the player making it a inflexion point, meaning this that anything that is not related to the main plot of the story of the game is directly not considered a main quest.
