## About the author

My name is [Ricardo Castro](https://github.com/RicardoCV2) and I'm a student on CITM on Terrassa.
This is my personal research under the supervision of the lecturer [Ricard Pillosu](https://es.linkedin.com/in/ricardpillosu)

## Introduction

It does not matter if they are small or large characteristics of a videogame, the missions have to have a development behind that helps both the player and the game itself, they are a factor that helps the feeling of immersion and of affiliation to the game that depends on creating a link with the player. A large majority of games tend to have a very bad approach in terms of Quest Design as they do not emphasize creating a game aimed for Quest Design and simply give it less relevance at the time of creation, this can tend to create a game and a totally flat product since it does not obtain factors of evolution. Companies that invest a lot of time and relevance in the questing aspect unlike the others, end up obtaining a great benefit and success by this aspect (e.g., The Witcher 3).
 During the article, three points will be the pinnacles for the research and the better understanding of what quests mean for a videogame and how much importance they have.
 * What they **are**
 * What they **must be like**
 * What do they **convey**
 
 # Quest - Main Quest - Side Quest
 
### Definition

“Quests are this place in a video game where game design, gaming and technology all come together.” [Jeszek Szczepanski - Building Non-Linear Narratives in Horizon: Zero Dawn (GDC 2017).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykPZcG8_mPU&feature=youtu.be)

The basic definition would be a task for a player or a group of players that may be completed to obtain a rewarding after succesfully completing it.

From this point we can focus on any action that the player makes can be converted into a quest, we simply have to award him a prize after completing that action. This factor is very short of explanation because within the action of the player we can find and have to be able to differentiate between a main quest and a side quest.

### Main Quest & Side Quests
Most people tend to think that a Main QUest is simply an action that you must complete to advance the game, and instead a Side Quest is a mission that the game or you decide whether to fulfill or not, no important effect on the core of the game. The problem with this conception is that if, for example, the history of a game is divided into different mission chains, and you choose the "A" option, this does not imply a set of missions that you had to complete to advance through the history of the game if you had decided otherwise. Similarly, there are some Side Quests that players must complete in order to level up or grind, making them not that “skippable” anymore.

### Main Quests 

According to Dean Razavi, Razbury Games Game Designer. a main quest is a big change in the plot of the narrative arc that create a new path for the player making it a inflexion point, meaning this that anything that is not related to the main plot of the story of the game is directly not considered a main quest.

 ### Side Quests
 
 The Side Quests help you understand and describe better and more deeply, the world that involves the main character as it explains and makes you discover a more in depth view of the main narrative arc of the game, all this while explaining secondary stories and discovering more things about its inhabitants and its lore.

## Main Pillars

The prerequisites that a Quest must have are:

* **Meaningful**, the player needs a direct connection with the game, needs to be engaged with it completely. Time will be spent and invested on the game and whether it is a 2 minutes or a three hours quest. We can't disappoint them letting them down by making the player into a situation where you are forced to do something that they are not enjoying just to get a better reward that will have better content later on the game.

* **Convey**, Mainly it has to express itself, it has to convey feelings and sensations,to make the previously mentioned connection a more easily accessible path, while narrating the facts that made that one village be what it is today, or explain what happened between these kids fighting over who gets to do something first.

* **Immersive & interactive**, the player has a dircet connection with the game, joining and taking part directly on it, he/she is not reading or watching a story be told, they are participating on it. They must feel important while playing, the game must create a sensation of immersion on the story making them feel like it changes the curse of the plot depending on the decisions and actions they made. If the player has no sensation of being part of the quest's narration, they won't relate to the characters and of course to the story, and we'll have failed them on its design.

## Quest Categories

We can classify the quests on 4 different types:

**Gather Quest**: "Go to the nearest forest and bring me 10 types of mushrooms."

**Escort Quest**: "Protect me and my father!", basically a protect an NPC on its way to another location.

**Delivery Quest**"Can you bring this to my sick mother next town warrior?", bring something from a NPC to another one to obtain something (normally the object you brought).

**Kill Quest**"Kill 5 Big Fang Wolves",classic killing quest.

# Quest Creation
## Concept

First of all you have to look at your own game from the outside, what kind of game we have, what kind of resources we have, can we do everything we want to do? Depending on the type of game that will be played, one type of resource or another will be used, you can use a larger system or a more closed system, you can create puzzles or mini-games,maybe only use killing quests.

If you have a narrow system the team can afford to work easier and co-ordinated, the game will also be affected since it will be much more repetitive and consequently, boring.
On the other hand if the team can afford a larger and wider system it allows you to freely do anything you want, the process will be more tedious and more extensive but quests will be interesting and most likely fun to play. 
The most efficient one is to be in the middle, so that your quest system is dynamic enough to be fast and have all the team members on the same page and allow for design freedom and interesting quest concepts at the same time. All the team has to agree while creating the quests system . programmers and artists don't seem a vital decision making but they will be the ones that create the system and the art, so they have to know what they can afford and what they don't.

Once the decisions have been done and the team knows what way they're heading its time to start the quest concepts. Brainstorming and writting all the ideas down is the best way to do it, then the team will filter them and choose. Try to avoid the first ones as they are the ones that create the most the "cliche" effect. Write, in a couple short sentences, what the concept of the quest would be, followed by what the player should do in order to complete it in a really general way.
The concept tends to be simple but the main ideas are already clear and express a concise idea,that indicates that the quest has potential
