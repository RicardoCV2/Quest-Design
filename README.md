## Introduction

It does not matter if they are small or large characteristics of a videogame, the missions have to have a development behind that helps both the player and the game itself, they are a factor that helps the feeling of immersion and of affiliation to the game that depends on creating a link with the player. A large majority of games tend to have a very bad approach in terms of Quest Design as they do not emphasize creating a game aimed for Quest Design and simply give it less relevance at the time of creation, this can tend to create a game and a totally flat product since it does not obtain factors of evolution. Companies that invest a lot of time and relevance in the questing aspect unlike the others, end up obtaining a great benefit and success by this aspect (e.g., The Witcher 3).
 During the article, three points will be the pinnacles for the research and the better understanding of what quests mean for a videogame and how much importance they have.
 * What they **are**
 * What they **must be like**
 * What do they **transmit**
 
 # Quest - Main Quest - Side Quest
 
### Definition

“Quests are this place in a video game where game design, gaming and technology all come together.” Jeszek Szczepanski - Building Non-Linear Narratives in Horizon: Zero Dawn (GDC 2017).

The basic definition would be a task for a player or a group of players that may be completed to obtain a rewarding after succesfully completing it.

From this point we can focus on any action that the player makes can be converted into a quest, we simply have to award him a prize after completing that action. This factor is very short of explanation because within the action of the player we can find and have to be able to differentiate between a main quest and a side quest.
