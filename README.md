## Introduction

It does not matter if they are small or large characteristics of a videogame, the missions have to have a development behind that helps both the player and the game itself, they are a factor that helps the feeling of immersion and of affiliation to the game that depends on creating a link with the player. A large majority of games tend to have a very bad approach in terms of Quest Design as they do not emphasize creating a game aimed for Quest Design and simply give it less relevance at the time of creation, this can tend to create a game and a totally flat product since it does not obtain factors of evolution. Companies that invest a lot of time and relevance in the questing aspect unlike the others, end up obtaining a great benefit and success by this aspect (e.g., The Witcher 3).
